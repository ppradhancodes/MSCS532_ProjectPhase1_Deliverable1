# Project: Developing and Optimizing Data Structures for Real-World Applications Using Python
## Objective:
In this project, you will apply your knowledge of data structures and algorithm analysis to design, implement, and optimize data structures for a specific real-world application using Python. Your project will include coding the data structures, running performance tests, analyzing results, and optimizing the structures for efficiency. The final submission will demonstrate your ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical, high-performance code and will include both a detailed report and a presentation.

This project will help you understand the practical challenges of implementing and optimizing data structures in real-world scenarios, focusing on both performance and scalability. You will work with Python, one of the most widely used programming languages in data science and software development, to bring your designs to life.

# Project Overview:
This project is divided into phases, each focusing on different aspects of data structure implementation and optimization.

# Phase 1: Data Structure Design and Implementation (Deliverable 1)
# Tasks:
# 1. Define the Application Context:

  - Choose a real-world application or use case that heavily relies on data structures (e.g., a search engine, a recommendation system, a social network graph).

  - Identify the key data structures needed for this application (e.g., trees, graphs, hash tables).

Below please find three example scenarios that could be used, students are not limited to these 4 examples and should pursue examples outside of these scenarios.

1. Search Engine Optimization:

Application Context: Develop a search engine that can efficiently handle large-scale queries across a vast dataset of web pages.

2. Social Network Analysis:

Application Context: Design an algorithm to analyze and find influential users in a social network like Twitter or Facebook.

3. Recommendation System for E-commerce:

Application Context: Create a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform that suggests products based on user behavior and preferences.

4. Dynamic Inventory Management:

Application Context: Implement an inventory management system that can handle dynamic changes in product quantities, prices, and categories.



# 2. Design the Data Structures:

  - Design the chosen data structures, considering factors like time complexity, space efficiency, and ease of implementation in Python.

  - Justify your design choices based on their suitability for the application and recent research findings.



# 3. Implement the Data Structures in Python:

  - Write Python code to implement the designed data structures.

  - Ensure that your implementation is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices for readability and performance.



# Deliverable 1 Requirements:

1. A written report (4 pages, excluding references and title page, APA format) detailing:
2. The application context and the chosen data structures.
3. The design rationale for each data structure.
4. An overview of the Python implementation, including pseudocode and/or code snippets.
5. A brief discussion of potential challenges and limitations.
6. Inclusion of at least 3 peer-reviewed sources for journals and/or textbooks, sources provided in the class are NOT permitted.
